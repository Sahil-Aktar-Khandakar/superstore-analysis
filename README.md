## Key Insights
-Technology is the top-performing category, contributing the highest share of total sales (about 36%), followed by Furniture and Office Supplies, each contributing over 30%.

-The Consumer segment generates more than half of total sales, outperforming the Corporate and Home Office segments.

-Sales are highly concentrated in California and New York, while most other states contribute relatively smaller sales volumes.

-Sales and quantity show a steady upward trend over time, while profit fluctuates more compared to sales.

-Comparison across Sales, Profit, and Quantity shows that products with high sales volume do not always generate high profit.
