## Key Insights
Technology is the top-performing category, contributing the highest share of total sales (~36%), followed by Furniture and Office Supplies, which show relatively similar contributions.

Consumer segment drives the majority of sales (over 50%), significantly outperforming Corporate and Home Office segments, indicating strong demand from individual consumers.

Sales are geographically concentrated, with California and New York contributing a disproportionately high share of total sales compared to other states.

Sales and Quantity trends show consistent growth over time, suggesting steady demand with periodic fluctuations rather than sharp volatility.

Metric comparison (Sales, Profit, Quantity) highlights that high sales volume does not always correspond to equally high profit, emphasizing the need to analyze profitability separately.
